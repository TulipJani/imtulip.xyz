# how to setup

simple.
get your api key if you're using ai in portfolio.

clone the repo.
make .env file in root directory.
keep the content for .env like this: "VITE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here"

that's it. change persona in App.jsx. and you're good to go. (if you encounter any issues, let me know) peace.
